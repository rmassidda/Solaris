## Synopsis
According to *The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy*, the space truckers of Magrathea have a perfect software that manages route, supplies and fuel for them. 

Unfortunately, *SuperSpace42â„¢* is proprietary and your license just expired while you were in outer space. The only good news is that those colored asteroids seems to be made up of the same material that powers your ship.

Try to catch them and see how far you can travel!

## How to run
A quick way to run a web server is using *SimpleHTTPServer*
> python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Then visit from a supported browser [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
