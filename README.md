# Solaris

## Synopsis
According to *The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy*, the space truckers of Magrathea have a perfect software that manages route, supplies and fuel for them.

Unfortunately, *SuperSpace42â„¢* is proprietary and your license just expired while you were in outer space!

Good news: those colored asteroids seems to be made up of the same material that powers your ship.

Try to catch them and see how far you can travel!

## Let's get technical!

This software has been developed as the final project of the Interface Programming course at the [University of Pisa](https://www.di.unipi.it/).

## How to run

Clone including submodules
> git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rmassidda/Solaris

A quick way to run a web server is using *SimpleHTTPServer*
> python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Then visit from a supported browser [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Otherwise you can try a live demo on my [personal website](https://rmassidda.it/solaris).
